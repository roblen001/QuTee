# QuTee

## 🚀 A Hybrid Quantum-Classical GPT Framework

QuTee is a modular and extensible research framework designed to seamlessly integrate quantum components within classical Transformer architectures (GPT-style models). Its primary purpose is to explore whether quantum-enhanced modules—such as variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for feed-forward layers or quantum kernel-based attention mechanisms—can offer measurable improvements in generalization, efficiency, and representational power for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Hybrid Experimentation:** Easily swap classical Transformer blocks with quantum-enhanced equivalents.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Evaluate and compare performance metrics such as loss, perplexity, training speed, inference latency, and model complexity.
- **Quantum Component Identification:** Pinpoint quantum methods that offer tangible advantages in current (NISQ-era) quantum simulations and devices.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Modular Design:**

  - Plug-and-play Transformer blocks with quantum-classical interoperability.
  - Clear abstraction layers for easy integration of quantum modules.

- **Simulation First:**

  - Initially target simulations using PennyLane with PyTorch backend.
  - Future compatibility with real quantum backends (IBM Quantum, Rigetti, IonQ).

- **Rapid Experimentation:**

  - Quick prototyping and deployment of hybrid components.
  - Simplified benchmarking framework for comparing classical and quantum performance.

- **Reproducibility:**
  - Structured codebase designed for clear, repeatable experiments.
  - Comprehensive logging, checkpointing, and metric tracking.
